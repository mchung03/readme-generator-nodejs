  ## Description
  CatFish is a game that allows users to catch fish to sell, in order to buy random cat facts. This project was built for entertainment purposes, with the inspiration of a creator that has an interest in Animal Crossing and love for cats. We learned to incorporate HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and third party APIs to create one website.

  N/A

  ## Usage
  Start by clicking the start button or reading the how to play. To start fishing, click the cast rod button. Wait until the reel in button pops up in randomly locations on your screen to catch fish. You can now go into your inventory to sell these fish and see the money in your wallet go up. Next, head over to the store once you have $5,000 to buy a random cat fact, generated from the MeowFacts API. If you try to buy a cat fact with insufficient funds, you'll be met with an angry store manager. There is also a character named CJ that you can sell fish to for a higher price, who pops up randomly.
