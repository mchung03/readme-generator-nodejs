# readme-generator-nodejs

## Description

The README generator was created to create a README and plugs the user input into a template. This solves the problem of having to continously write out all the subheading by easily creating a README for projects. I learned to use JavaScript and template literals to have the function run in NodeJS. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

1. Have Node.js. If not, download it here. (https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Navigate to the project and type in "node index.js" in your terminal to execute the functions
3. Answer the prompts as follows
4. Your README will be generated in the file "createdREADME.md"

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
