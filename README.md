# readme-generator-nodejs

## Description

The README generator was created to create a README and plugs the user input into a template. This solves the problem of having to continously write out all the subheading by easily creating a README for projects. I learned to use JavaScript and template literals to have the function run in NodeJS. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
